# The Micronaut's modifed So Simple Theme 

Micronaut's modified So Simple Theme is based upon the  simplistic **So Simple Theme**  originally created by [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com).

Micronaut's modified So Simple Theme is a minimalistic theme (across the same lines of the So Simple Theme) that offers simple and clean layout while emphasizing typography. This theme is ideal for storytelling blogs.

See a [live Demo](http://themicronaut.github.io/) of Micronaut's modified So Simple Theme hosted on GitHub.
